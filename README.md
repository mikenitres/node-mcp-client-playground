Example `.env` file can be found in the default folder named `env`. Fill it up and place it in the root folder before running the program

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside this Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ api
â”‚          â””â”€â”€ mcpclient.ts
â”‚          â””â”€â”€ slack.ts
â”‚          â””â”€â”€ email.ts
â”‚          â””â”€â”€ increment.astro
â”‚          â””â”€â”€ decrement.astro
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ send-email.astro
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ counter.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ styles/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ chat.css
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utils/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ tool-selector.ts
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
